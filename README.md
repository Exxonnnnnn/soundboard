# A very bad website

So I decided to change it a bit, it's no longer just a soundboard. It now has other options for games such as rock paper scissors, tictactoe etc. I have to say, tic tac toe and connect4 are the best ones :).

You can see the github pages site [here](https://exxonnnnnn.github.io/soundboard/)

> Remember I don't know CSS / Dislike css because I'm not a good designer, it wasn't made to look brilliantly it was just to mess around with it :)

# A very bad soundboard

I wouldn't recommend this soundboard, for a start you can only have 9 sounds with the way it does it, it has basically no css because I hate css and the js in it is probs the long way of doing it. :)

You can see the github pages site [here](https://exxonnnnnn.github.io/soundboard/)
> Remember I don't know CSS / Dislike css because I'm not a good designer, it wasn't made to look brilliantly it was just to mess around with it :)
